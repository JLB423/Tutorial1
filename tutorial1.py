### PUSH FROM LOCAL TO GITHUB ###

#	In the terminal make sure you are in the directory where your file that you want to push to git is located
#	git init    # this initializes the git repository 
#	git add filenamethatyouwanttoadd
#	git commit –m “Created filename” –m “description goes here..”..
#	**git push origin master   ##**** this will give an error since this file didn’t originate as a git repository
# So, first we have to create an empty git repository on github 
#	Copy the link from the repo
#	git remote add origin pastethelinkfromyourrepo
#	git push origin master    # note in the future you don’t have to include origin master,  git push –u origin master   this will remember this moving forward. 

# Local changes made - save to a new branch
